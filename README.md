# jquery.event.ue

## Summary
Use this **unified event** plugin to applications that easily and seamlessly support 
mobile (touch) **and** desktop (mouse) environments. 

The plugin recognizes mouse, keyboard, and touch motions that have 
identical *intent* and publishes a single **unified event** for each. For example, a long-press 
*intent* on a desktop is expressed by a *motion* where a user clicks on the LMB for over 
0.5s without substantially moving the mouse.  A long-press *intent* on a phone or tablet
is expressed by a *motion* where a user touches on a screen for over 0.5s without 
substantially moving the touch point. This plugin recognizes the identical *intents* and 
publishes the same `uheld` event for either. It does so for many *intents*:

- click (tap)
- long-press (long-tap)
- drag (swipe)
- long-press-drag (long-press-swipe)
- zoom (pinch-to-zoom)

This plugin is used in multiple commercial SPAs and is featured in the best-selling book 
[Single Page Web Applications - JavaScript end-to-end][1], also [available on Amazon][2].

Please see the `ue-test.html` file for a demonstration of the different intents. Expected 
behavior is expressed in the BR corner of the tiles. If you see any unexpected behavior 
while testing motions on your device please file a bug report so I can fix it.

This plugin is designed to work with jQuery 1.7.0+, and has been tested on most jQuery 
versions through 2.1.4.

## Browser Support
This plugin works with the latest versions of popular browsers: 
Chrome 15+, Firefox 23+, Safari 5+, and IE 9+. IE9 requires edge settings:

```html
  <head><meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
  ....
```

## Examples
```js
    // bind to a mouse click or tap event
    $( '#utap' ) .on( 'utap',  onTap   );

    // bind to a long-press event
    $( '#uheld' ).on( 'uheld', onHeld  );

    // bind to zoom events
    $( '#uzoom' )
       .bind( 'uzoomstart', onZoomstart )
       .bind( 'uzoommove',  onZoommove  )
       .bind( 'uzoomend',   onZoomend   )
       ;

    // bind to drag events
    $( '#udrag' )
      .bind( 'udragstart', onDragstart )
      .bind( 'udragmove',  onDragmove  )
      .bind( 'udragend',   onDragend   )
      ;

    // bind to hold-drag events
    $('#uhelddrag')
      .bind('uheldstart', onDragstart )
      .bind('uheldmove',  onDragmove  )
      .bind('uheldend',   onDragend   )
      ;
```

## Intents
The following *intents* are supported:

- click (tap)
- long-press (long-tap)
- drag (swipe): start, move, end
- long-press-drag (long-press-swipe): start, move, end
- zoom (pinch-to-zoom): start, move, end

See the `ue-test.html` file for example use of the 
event object.

### The click intent
A click *intent* results in a `utap` event.
- The *Desktop* motion is *Left Mouse Button [LMB] down-up*
  where the mouse-down time is less than the tap tolerance and
  the location movement is less than the drag tolerance.
- The *Touch* motion is *touchstart-move-end* where
  the touch time is less than the tap tolerance and the location
  movement is less than the drag tolerance.

You may tweak the tap, drag, and long-press tolerances
in the `defaultOptMap` at the top of the lib. The API will have
a method to change these values in the future.

### The long-press intent
A long-press *intent* results in a `uheld` event.
- The *Desktop* motion is *Left Mouse Button [LMB] down-up*
  where the mouse-down time exceeds the long-press tolerance and
  the location movement is less than the drag tolerance.
- The *Touch* motion is *touchstart-move-end* where 
  the touch time exceeds the long-press tolerance and
  the location movement is less than the drag tolerance.

### The drag intent
A drag *intent* results in a single `udragstart` event, one or more
`udragmove` events, and a final `udragend` event.
- The *Desktop* motion is *LMB down - mouse-move - LMB up*
  where the mouse-down time exceeds the tap tolerance and 
  the location movement is greater than the drag tolerance.
- The *Touch* is *touchstart-move-end*, where 
  the touch time is exceeds the tap tolerance and
  the location movement is less than the drag tolerance.

Event order:
- `udragstart` - fires at the start of a drag (LMB down or finger press where motion has moved out of the drag radius)
- `udragmove`  - fires each time the mouse or finger moves
- `udragend`   - fires at the end of a drag (LMB up or finger release)

### The zoom intent
A zoom *intent* results in a single `uzoomstart` event, one or more
`uzoommove` events, and a final `uzoomend` event.

- The *Desktop* motion is *shift+LMB down - move-mouse - LMB up* where
  the mouse-down time exceeds the tap tolerance and
  the location movement is greater than the drag tolerance.
- The *Touch* motion is *two-point-touch - point-move - two-point-release*.

Event order:
- `uzoomstart` - fires at the start of zoom
- `uzoommove`  - fires as zoom amount changes
- `uzoomend`   - fires at end of zoom motion

## Event Attributes
The event object for all **ue** events include these attributes in addition 
to those already provided by jQuery:

```js
var attr_list = [
  event.px_start_x,    // X-position at start of motion
  event.px_start_y,    // Y-ibid
  event.px_current_x,  // X-position, current
  event.px_current_y,  // Y-ibid
  event.px_end_x,      // X-position for x at end of motion
  event.px_end_y,      // Y-ibid
  event.px_delta_zoom, // Zoom delta since last motion event
  event.px_delta_x,    // X-ibid
  event.px_delta_y,    // Y-ibid
  event.px_tdelta_x,   // X-delta since beginning of motion
  event.px_tdelta_y,   // Y-ibid
  event.orig_target,   // Element under cursor at start of motion
  event.elem_bound,    // Element on which event was bound
  event.elem_target,   // Element under the cursor for *this* event
  event.timeStamp,     // Timestamp of this event
  event.ms_elapsed,    // Elapsed time since start of motion
  event.ms_timestart,  // Start time of motion
  event.ms_timestop,   // top time of motion
];
```

## Error handling
This code ignores bad input, and does not throw exceptions.  As JS implementations are (finally) seeing improved exception handling, expect this to change in 2.x.

## Namespacing
jQuery event namespacing is fully supported, as shown in this example:

```js
$( '#msg' )
  .on( 'utap.mytap',  onTapMsg  )
  .on( 'uheld.mytap', onHeldMsg );

$( '#msg' ).unbind( '.mytap' );
```
## Use libraries, not frameworks
This is a library that strives to be best-in-class.
If you are considering using an SPA framework, please read [Do you
really want an SPA framework?][0] first.
